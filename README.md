# starbeam.one home Repository

This is a basic central repository for issue-tracking and documentation (wiki) for [starbeam.one](https://alpha.starbeam.one).

No code is yet found here but maybe we will add it in the future? 🤔

We have a simple wiki location for articles of documentation that pop up in onboarding here:

https://starbeam-one.gitbook.io/home

And all our identified issues are being tracked here:

https://github.com/StarbeamOne/home/issues

If you are tech/agile-centric, may we interest you in our StarbeamOne YouTube channel featuring semi-weekly standups based on Agile methodologies?
