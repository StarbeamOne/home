# starbeam.one home Repository

This is a basic central repository for issue-tracking and documentation (wiki).

No code is yet found here but maybe we will add it in the future? 🤔

We have a simple wiki location for articles of documentation that pop up in onboarding here:

https://github.com/StarbeamOne/home/wiki

And all our identified issues are being tracked here:

https://github.com/StarbeamOne/home/issues

Thank you very much to everyone out there who has expressed interest in starbeam.one 🙏🌟
